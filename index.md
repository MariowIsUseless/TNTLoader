# TNT Loader

TNT Loader is an advanced Fabric API version, compatible with ANY mods.

**NOTE**: you need the most recent version of [Fabric Loader](https://maven.fabricmc.net/net/fabricmc/fabric-installer/0.10.2/fabric-installer-0.10.2.exe) to use the API.

### Errors

- Fabric API not found

In case fabric gives you an error: "Fabric API not found" just click [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/download/3689020/file) and then, click on the file in "Downloads" and press F2, then press CTRL+A and then press CTRL+C. Go ahead in %appdata%\.minecraft\mods and click on TNTLoader.jar, press F2 then press CTRL+A, and then CTRL+V.

- Fabric API is outdated

That means that the version of the loader is newer than the API, that means you need to download a new version, if you downloaded the latest, and, still getting this error, i'm still working on a new version, and you need to use the standard API.

- Game crashes or -1 error code

That means that some of your mods made the game crash, you need to remove the one you think is, and then start the game if you still get the error, you need to test one-at once.
