# TNTLoader
An advanced API for fabric/fabric mods.

This works with ANY fabric-based mods.

**WARNING: JAVA 16 RUNTIME IS REQUIRED TO INSTALL FABRIC AND RUN APIs**

## Errors

If Minecraft gives you an error: Missing fabric loader, [click here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/download/3689020/file), go on the Downloads folder, find fabric-api-0.48.0+1.18.2.jar and press F2, click CTRL+A and then CTRL+C. Press WIN+R on your keyboard and type in %appdata%\.minecraft\mods\, search for TNTLoader.jar (it may have a different name, varies by the relase) and press F2, then press CTRL+A and then CTRL+V.

_P.S=i don't use linux/macos, the process may be different for you, but i cannnot explain it to you, because i don't use Linux-Based systemsðŸ˜¥_

If Minecraft gives you an error: Outdated API, re-download the version and follow the steps up here. If you still get the error, i'm still developing a new version, and you need to use the basilar API.
